= Help compiler =
=================

If you don't have the Microsoft help compiler on your hard disk, you can download it from this site:

http://www.danish-shareware.dk/soft/shelpmbeta/index.html

If you already has the compiler on your disk then you just need to tell Shalom Help Maker where to find it. Check the program options in SHM.

You can't make help files without the help compiler!

The help compiler is made up of these files:

hcw.exe
hcrtf.exe
hwdll.dll

= Shalom Help Maker v0.5.2 =
============================

New in version 0.5.2:

- Added: Now you can change the colors and the width of Page Jumper in 
  Program Options. 
- Added menu item Remove Ctrl+Alt Shortcuts to the Options menu. Also 
  changed a few shortcuts in the Search and Tools menus. On Polish keyboards
  Ctrl+Alt shortcuts interfere with the creation of certain characters. 
- Added menu item Show Project Stats... to the File menu. Shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+W. 
- Added 6 snippet buttons. Right-click one to open the Snippets Configuration 
  window. Left-click to display the snippet menu. Shortcuts: Alt+1..6. 
- Added menu items Configure Snippets and Hide Snippet Buttons to the Options 
  menu.
- Added menu item Repeat Snippet to the Tools menu and the popup menu. 
  Shortcut: Shift+Ctrl+E. 
- Added menu item Make A New Snippet to the popup menu. 
- Added: Now you can open the Page Jumper by right-clicking the 'Keywords:' 
  label. Left-clicking it still opens the Keyword Editor. 
- Added Use Windows Colors button to the Editor and files tab in Program Options.
- Added: Now the List Occurrences Of, Show Links To This Target and Search help 
  index... features remember the most recently used words/target. 
- Added: When you move the mouse over a color in the vertical toolbar, its number
  and your comment (if any) will be displayed in the status bar. This is faster 
  than waiting for the tooltip to pop up. 
- Changed: If a word is selected when you press F1, the help file will be searched
  for the word. So you can select some code or a word and get help on it (with a 
  little luck). If nothing is selected F1 will display the front page of the help 
  file. 
- Changed: Now the font, font color and background color of the Keyword Editor is
  the same as in the editor. 
- Changed the way the 'dummy.hlp' is entered in the cnt file to avoid problems 
  when using the Find tab.

Installation:
Unzip the files to a new folder (keep the old version and the 'old' shp files 
until you know that the new one works ok). The compiler files can be placed in
a separate folder. Just remember to tell Shalom Help Maker where they are (in 
program options).

[Import of help projects (RTF and other files) is not a feature I'll be adding
anytime soon. The same goes for exporting files for printing.]
