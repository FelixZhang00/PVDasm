; map file should add functions in the code flow (still unknown)

1. add code to view strings (in a dialog) when user type in an address.
this is to ease the user if the disassembly is not complete,

1) file lock on open, i understand some people may even prefer this but
I'd really like to see an option to make this either lock or non-lock so,
 that a snapshot of a build can be viewed and compared with another build. As it is, this locking is a major inconvenience for me.

2) on the tool bar, I'd really prefer to have 2 more buttons to open/close files
more quickly rather than go through the mouse clicks

3) move the docking asm window out of the way, at least it should not hide the view of subsequent instructions after call/jmp etc.

1. add bookmarks (by index, shows the text)

01.02.2005:

- try to add an 'invoke,xxx,xxx' option in MASM Wizard.
- Add A dynamic data Shifting (DDS) when adding/removing a function

07.03.2005:
-exe packed with FSG 2.0 crashes PVDasm.

22.06.2005:
if error found (invalid section), add a select section screen to disassemble. (packed files, e.g: FSG)

24.06.2005:
add project save db size prediction information.

27.08.2005:
when changing the size of a column header and mouse is moving over a jmp/call
instruction, the mouse calculation is not currect when the mouse is over the instrucion,
once moved it will trigger the pop up window on a blank right x-pixels when mouse is over.
